    Reading was instilled in me from a young age, first by my parents who loved
    to read to me, and later by myself. Besides reading stories, I also really
    enjoy writing stories myself. That, too, started at a young age when I told
    all kinds of stories to my dolls as I walked around the house. My family
    also listened eagerly to everything I had to say. When I got older, I really
    started writing, mainly in the form of fanfiction about my most beloved
    books (Lord of the Rings), series (The Walking Dead, Teen Wolf), and films
    (Narnia).

    a story about Orions who created and live on the island of Nador, but have
    to use all their powers to prevent the world from ending. I had wanted to
    write a book for a long time, so I chose to pursue a minor in creative
    writing. In six months, I wrote the book and published it in print. My <a

    brother</a> designed the fantastic cover and illustrations.
