    Here follow the chronicles of the Orions as they have been passed down
    through generations. Be warned, for this story must not be forgotten. One

    will have to pay the price.

    the Orions created the island of Nador. But when one of them, Rhena, sees
    the young world perish in a vision, the Orions are confronted with a future
    beyond even their powers. To save Nador, one of them must pay the ultimate

  description1: >-
    Reading was instilled in me from a young age, first by my parents who loved
    to read to me, and later by myself. Besides reading stories, I also really
    enjoy writing stories myself. That, too, started at a young age when I told
    all kinds of stories to my dolls as I walked around the house. My family
    also listened eagerly to everything I had to say. When I got older, I really
    started writing, mainly in the form of fanfiction about my most beloved
    books (The Lord of the Rings), series (The Walking Dead, Teen Wolf), and films
    (Narnia).

    I also wrote a book: <span class="cinzel-decorative">Levensadem</span>. It's
    a story about Orions who created and live on the island of Nador, but have
    to use all their powers to prevent the world from ending. I had wanted to
    write a book for a long time, so I chose to pursue a minor in creative
    writing. In six months, I wrote the book and published it in print. My <a

    brother</a> designed the fantastic cover and illustrations.
